# Tmux supports plugins for color schemes. Not sure how we can choose this from
# the CLI
#
# Nvim same as tmux will have color config via a plugin that is installed by its
# own package manager. We might be able to trigger lazy to update.
#
# BAT has a command line. We should be able to do a copy
#
# Waybar supports a stylesheet that we should be able to copy in and out
#
# Wofi supports theme files and should be easy
#
# Hyprland is currently not part of the configuration so we should bring that
# in to this project first
