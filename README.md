# Dot Files

These are my personal dotfiles somewhat based on rwxrob's dot files.  Check him 
out on twitch https://www.twitch.tv/rwxrob. The github repo for his dotfiles 
is here and well worth a look https://github.com/rwxrob/dot. This repo is 
intended to function as a stand alone project that is able to configure 
a complete terminal environment. Each subfolder of the configuration implements
a setup file that is responsible for putting file configurations in their 
correct places.

## Usage 

Run setup. 

## Prereqs
 * zsh
 * nvim
 * bat for cat
 * https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
 * https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/


## TODO 
 * Setup a health check function that will test for all requirements and fail
   if they are not met.
 * Figure out how to package up deps in my paths. We should remove that from
   this configuration
 * Start building up a vim configuration
