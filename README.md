# Dot Files

Based somewhat on rwxrob's dot files and ideas around note taking. Check him out on twitch https://www.twitch.tv/rwxrob. The github repo for his dotfiles is here and well worth a look https://github.com/rwxrob/dot. One key idea I'm borrowing is the setup script. First each part of of the setup provides its own setup file and second the setup links in to the home dir.

## Prereqs
 * zsh
 * nvim
 * https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
 * https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/


## TODO 
 * Import nvim configuration
 * Start building up a vim configuration
 * Setup a health check function that will test for all requirements and fail
   if they are not met.
